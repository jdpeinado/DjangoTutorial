This is the code for the tutorial in the djangoproject site for Django 1.6.

This is for own learning, but anyone can colaborate.

The commits are "part01, part02, part03, part04-1, part04-2, part05 and part06". You can move with git for each part and see the explanation in https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/

I have separated the part04 in two because I think it will be clear about the clase_based_views.
